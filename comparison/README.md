# API Gateway Comparison Benchmarks

Performance comparison suite that benchmarks **Ferrum Gateway** against **Kong** and **Tyk** API Gateways under identical conditions.

## What It Measures

Each gateway is tested as a pure reverse proxy (no authentication, rate limiting, or transformation plugins) with two scenarios:

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **HTTP (plaintext)** | Client → Gateway (port 8000) → Backend. Measures raw proxy overhead. |
| **HTTPS (TLS termination)** | Client → Gateway (port 8443, TLS) → Backend (plaintext). Measures TLS handshake and encryption overhead at the gateway. |

Two endpoints are tested per scenario:
- `/health` — instant backend response, measures pure gateway latency
- `/api/users` — 100 microsecond simulated delay, represents a typical API call

A direct backend baseline (no gateway) is run first for comparison.

### Test Approach

- Gateways are tested **sequentially** (one at a time) to avoid resource contention
- Each test gets a **5-second warm-up** (results discarded) before the measured 30-second run
- The same backend echo server, wrk parameters, and endpoints are used across all gateways
- Ferrum runs as a native binary; Kong runs natively if installed (preferred) or in Docker; Tyk runs in Docker (no official macOS binary)
- The script auto-detects native Kong and prefers it over Docker for fairer benchmarking

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Required | Install |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **wrk** | Yes | `brew install wrk` (macOS) or `apt install wrk` (Ubuntu) |
| **Python 3** | Yes | Usually pre-installed; needed for report generation |
| **Rust/Cargo** | Yes | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) — builds Ferrum and the backend server |
| **curl** | Yes | Usually pre-installed; used for health checks |
| **Docker** | For Tyk (always), Kong (if not native) | [docs.docker.com/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) |
| **Kong** (native) | Recommended | See below |

### Native Kong Installation (Recommended for Fair Benchmarks)

Installing Kong natively eliminates Docker overhead and provides the fairest comparison against Ferrum. The script auto-detects a native `kong` binary and uses it automatically.

**macOS:** No native macOS binary is officially available — Docker is the only supported option on macOS. If you have a Kong binary from another source, place it on your `$PATH` and the script will use it.

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://packages.konghq.com/public/gateway-39/setup.deb.sh' | sudo bash
sudo apt install kong
```

**RHEL/CentOS:**
```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://packages.konghq.com/public/gateway-39/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo bash
sudo yum install kong
```

### Native Tyk Installation (Linux Only)

Tyk has no official macOS binary. On Linux, native installation is available:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/setup.deb.sh' | sudo bash
sudo apt install tyk-gateway
```

Tyk always requires Redis (`brew install redis` on macOS, `apt install redis-server` on Linux).

On macOS, Tyk runs in Docker — see the "Docker Overhead" section below for what this means for results.

**System recommendations:** Run on a dedicated machine or close resource-intensive applications. CPU governor set to "performance" improves consistency on Linux.

## Quick Start

```bash
# From the project root
./comparison/run_comparison.sh
```

The script will:
1. Pull Kong and Tyk Docker images
2. Build Ferrum Gateway and the backend server (release mode)
3. Run baseline → Ferrum → Kong → Tyk tests sequentially
4. Generate an HTML comparison report in `comparison/results/`

Open `comparison/results/comparison_report.html` in a browser to view the results.

## Configuration

Override any parameter via environment variables:

```bash
# Custom test parameters
WRK_DURATION=60s WRK_THREADS=12 WRK_CONNECTIONS=200 ./comparison/run_comparison.sh

# Skip a gateway (e.g., if you don't have Docker)
SKIP_GATEWAYS=tyk,kong ./comparison/run_comparison.sh

# Only test Ferrum vs Kong
SKIP_GATEWAYS=tyk ./comparison/run_comparison.sh
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `WRK_DURATION` | `30s` | Duration of each measured test run |
| `WRK_THREADS` | `8` | wrk thread count |
| `WRK_CONNECTIONS` | `100` | wrk concurrent connections |
| `WARMUP_DURATION` | `5s` | Warm-up duration before each test (results discarded) |
| `KONG_VERSION` | `3.9` | Kong Docker image tag |
| `TYK_VERSION` | `v5.7` | Tyk Docker image tag |
| `SKIP_GATEWAYS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated gateways to skip: `ferrum`, `kong`, `tyk` |

## Swapping Gateway Versions

To re-run benchmarks with newer Kong or Tyk releases:

```bash
# Test against Kong 3.10 and Tyk v5.8
KONG_VERSION=3.10 TYK_VERSION=v5.8 ./comparison/run_comparison.sh
```

The script pulls the specified Docker image tags automatically. Results are overwritten in `comparison/results/` — copy or rename the directory if you want to preserve previous runs.

### Version-specific considerations

- **Kong** uses DB-less declarative mode. The config format (`_format_version: "3.0"`) is stable across 3.x releases. If Kong 4.x changes the format, update `comparison/configs/kong.yaml`.
- **Tyk** uses standalone mode with file-based API definitions. The API definition schema has been stable across v5.x. If Tyk v6 changes it, update the files in `comparison/configs/tyk/apps/`.
- **Ferrum** is built from source in the current checkout, so it always tests the latest local code.

## Interpreting Results

The HTML report contains four sections:

### 1. Direct Backend Baseline
Raw backend throughput and latency without any gateway. This is the theoretical maximum. Any gateway will add overhead.

### 2. HTTP Performance (Plaintext)
Compares all three gateways proxying plaintext HTTP. Key metrics:
- **Requests/sec** — higher is better. The gateway closest to baseline has the least overhead.
- **Avg Latency** — lower is better. The difference from baseline is the gateway's added latency.
- **P99 Latency** — tail latency matters for user experience. Large P99 spikes indicate inconsistent performance.
- **Errors** — should be zero. Non-zero errors indicate the gateway couldn't handle the load.
- **vs Baseline** — percentage RPS difference from direct backend.

### 3. HTTPS Performance (TLS Termination)
Same metrics but with TLS between wrk and the gateway. Expect lower throughput and higher latency than HTTP due to TLS handshake cost.

### 4. TLS Overhead
Per-gateway comparison of HTTP vs HTTPS performance. Shows the RPS drop and latency increase each gateway pays for TLS. A gateway with lower TLS overhead has a more efficient TLS implementation.

### Color coding
- **Green cells** = best in category (highest RPS, lowest latency)
- **Red cells** = worst in category

## Initial Findings

The following results were collected on macOS (Apple Silicon) with 8 threads, 100 connections, and 30-second measured runs. Kong and Tyk ran in Docker; Ferrum ran natively.

### Raw Results

| Gateway | Protocol | /health req/s | /api/users req/s | /health latency | /api/users latency |
|---------|----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Baseline** (no gateway) | HTTP | 212,146 | 53,223 | 0.38 ms | 1.71 ms |
| **Ferrum** (native) | HTTP | 97,846 | 40,610 | 0.98 ms | 2.34 ms |
| **Ferrum** (native) | HTTPS | 93,481 | 41,240 | 1.04 ms | 2.32 ms |
| **Kong 3.9** (Docker) | HTTP | 26,527 | 24,706 | 3.70 ms | 3.92 ms |
| **Kong 3.9** (Docker) | HTTPS | 23,462 | 21,870 | 4.97 ms | 4.79 ms |
| **Tyk v5.7** (Docker) | HTTP | 2,350 | 2,703 | 3.82 ms | 6.67 ms |
| **Tyk v5.7** (Docker) | HTTPS | 3,406 | 3,772 | 2.63 ms | 1.85 ms |

### Adjusting for Docker Overhead

Kong and Tyk ran in Docker on macOS, which adds ~0.1–0.5 ms latency per request and reduces throughput by ~5–15% (see [Docker Overhead](#docker-overhead)). Even after generously accounting for this:

| Gateway | /health req/s (adjusted) | Ferrum Advantage |
|---------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Ferrum** (native) | 97,846 | — |
| **Kong** (Docker, +15% adjusted) | ~30,500 | **3.2x faster** |
| **Tyk** (Docker, +15% adjusted) | ~2,700 | **36x faster** |

**Key takeaways:**
- **Ferrum is 3–4x faster than Kong** on pure proxy throughput, even after giving Kong a generous 15% Docker adjustment. The latency gap (0.98 ms vs 3.70 ms) far exceeds the ~0.1–0.5 ms Docker overhead — most of Kong's overhead is real gateway processing time.
- **Ferrum is 36x+ faster than Tyk** on the /health endpoint. Tyk's throughput numbers are an order of magnitude lower regardless of Docker overhead adjustments.
- **Ferrum's TLS overhead is near zero** — HTTPS throughput (93,481 req/s) is within 5% of HTTP (97,846 req/s), indicating an efficient TLS implementation.
- **Docker overhead accounts for at most ~0.5 ms of the latency gap.** Ferrum's latency advantage over Kong is ~2.7 ms and over Tyk is ~2.8–4.9 ms — the vast majority of this is real gateway overhead, not Docker artifact.

For the most apples-to-apples comparison, run on Linux where all three gateways can be installed natively.

## Adding a New Gateway

To add a new gateway (e.g., Envoy, NGINX, Traefik):

1. **Create config files** in `comparison/configs/` for the gateway
2. **Add functions** to `run_comparison.sh`:
   - `start_<gateway>_http()` / `start_<gateway>_https()` — launch the gateway
   - `stop_<gateway>()` — tear it down
   - `test_<gateway>()` — orchestrate HTTP + HTTPS test sequences
3. **Add the gateway name** to the `GATEWAYS` list in `scripts/generate_comparison_report.py`
4. **Call `test_<gateway>()`** in the `main()` function of `run_comparison.sh`
5. **Add a `should_skip` check** so users can skip it via `SKIP_GATEWAYS`

Each test function should follow the pattern: start → run_wrk (per endpoint) → stop. Use the same ports (8000/8443) since gateways run sequentially.

## Docker Overhead

When a gateway runs in Docker instead of natively, there is measurable overhead that affects benchmark results. The amount varies by platform:

| Platform | Networking Mode | Added Latency | Throughput Impact | Notes |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Linux** | `--network host` | < 5 μs | < 1% | Negligible; containers share the host network stack |
| **Linux** | port mapping (`-p`) | ~10–50 μs | ~2–5% | Userspace proxy adds a small hop |
| **macOS** | port mapping (`-p`) | ~0.1–0.5 ms | ~5–15% | Docker Desktop runs in a Linux VM; each packet crosses the VM boundary + userspace networking |

**On macOS**, Docker overhead is the most significant. Docker Desktop 4.19+ improved this with the gVisor TCP/IP stack (5x faster than the older vpnkit), but the VM boundary remains. CPU scheduling variance is also ~9.5x higher in the VM compared to native.

**To minimize Docker overhead:**
1. On Linux, install Kong and Tyk natively via package managers (see Prerequisites above)
2. On Linux with Docker, `--network host` is used automatically (negligible overhead)
3. On macOS, no native Kong or Tyk binaries exist — Docker overhead is unavoidable. Interpret results with the overhead estimates above in mind

The HTML report's "Methodology & Caveats" section notes which gateways ran natively vs in Docker.

## Known Limitations

- **No plugins enabled:** Tests measure pure proxy overhead only. Real-world performance with authentication, rate limiting, or transformation plugins will differ. Each gateway has different plugin performance characteristics.

- **TLS termination only:** The HTTPS tests terminate TLS at the gateway and proxy to the backend over plaintext HTTP. This is the most common production pattern but does not test gateway-to-backend TLS (re-encryption). Ferrum, Kong, and Tyk all support backend TLS but it is not benchmarked here.

- **Single-node only:** All tests run on localhost. Distributed deployment characteristics (network latency, cluster synchronization) are not captured.

- **In-memory state:** Tyk requires Redis even in standalone mode. The Redis instance runs locally and is fast, but it's a dependency that Kong and Ferrum don't need, which could slightly affect Tyk's resource usage.

- **Tyk on macOS:** No native macOS binary exists, so Tyk always runs in Docker on macOS. On Linux, Tyk can be installed natively via packagecloud (adding native Tyk support to this script is a welcome contribution).
